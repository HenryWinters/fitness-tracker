## About the App 

Liftpad is a social media fitness application for weightlifters. It allows you to log your workout routines, track your progress, and share it with others. 

The app has a simple mobile-first design, designed to give you the ability to log your exercises, sets, reps, and weight as you progress through your workout. 

You’ll have access to a feed to view your network’s workouts, an individual feed to view your own, and profile pages to track and share your progress with your following.
